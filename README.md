#### - 14.10.2024 -
#### Started the work on displaying more information about selected day.
#
#### - 15.10.2024 -
#### Displaying correct information about selected day works now and also added city search function.
#### Done with the most functions that i wanted for the app for now. Only bugfixing and adding more icons etc.
#### Might also add feature that changes the background depending on weatcher condition (animated background would be cool).
#### And also might try to add a feature that lets you save citys as favourites, but that needs a database, so not sure about that right know.
